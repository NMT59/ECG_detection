# ECG_detection

I.Overview:

This project focuses on developing a system for detecting cardiac arrhythmias using deep learning techniques. The workflow involves preprocessing ECG signals, training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and validating its accuracy and reliability for real-world applications in cardiac diagnosis.

II.Workflow:

Step 1: Data Preprocessing

-Dataset: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database

-Preprocessing Steps:

    *Noise removal to eliminate artifacts and improve signal clarity.

    *Normalization to standardize the data range.

    *Segmentation to divide ECG signals into manageable portions for analysis.

Step 2: Building and Training the CNN Model

-Programming Language: Python

-Libraries Used: TensorFlow or PyTorch

-Description: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed and trained to classify arrhythmias based on the preprocessed ECG signals.

Step 3: Performance Enhancement

-Data Augmentation: Enhances training data diversity by creating synthetic variations of ECG signals.

-Overfitting Prevention: Regularization techniques to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Step 4: Model Validation

-Validation Process: The trained model is tested on a separate test set to evaluate its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overall reliability in arrhythmia classification.

-Preprocessing pipeline for ECG signal cleaning and preparation.

-Deep learning model leveraging CNN architecture for arrhythmia detection.

-Use of data augmentation to improve model performance and robustness.

-Rigorous validation for real-world applicability in cardiac diagnostics.
